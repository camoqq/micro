    FullDesc: `**The Offer That’s Shaking Up Functional and Integrative Medicine**\n
Let’s get one thing out of the way: Yes, this is real. You&#39;re looking at an AI-powered
platform custom-built for functional, holistic, and integrative practitioners. This
development would easily cost $10,000 to $15,000 to build on your own. We’re offering
it to early adopters for just $697.<br><br>

Why? Because this isn’t just a one-off software development project. It’s the beginning
of a movement, an uprising. This isn’t a scheme, a SaaS gimmick, an MLM, or a “rags-
to-riches” funnel. We didn’t create H6FIT to sell a product or services. We created it to
solve the system-wide crisis of rampant chronic disease: to prevent it, mitigate it, even
reverse it.<br><br>
You already saw the dysfunction: insurance red tape, burnout EMRs, protocol fatigue,
and the hollow promise of “patient-centered care” that never delivered. So you walked
away—not from medicine, but from mediocrity. You chose a better path: holistic,
functional, integrative care.<br><br>
Meanwhile, AI is being developed for traditional healthcare systems-not the healers.
That is changing. We didn’t set out to change the current sick-care system. Instead,
we’ve built a new one. The H6FIT Wellcare Omniverse, 11 years in the making, is an AI-
powered system built for Functional, Integrative, and Root-Cause practitioners. And
because we invested over 11 years and $2 million to build it and test the design,
revenues, and memberships, we didn’t need outside investors telling us what to do.<br><br>
The result: we built a new care model, one that respects root-cause practitioners, puts
well-being at the center, and provides more autonomy in the practice of holistic medicine
and at scale, at a reduced cost, and still profitable.<br><br>
We didn’t try to fix the broken sick-care system. We built a new one.
Welcome to the H6FIT Wellcare Omniverse, a first-of-its-kind, AI-powered, biophilic,
virtual practice habitat. It’s immersive, intelligent, and persuasive by design,engineered
to improve outcomes, lower costs, and scale your care without burnout.<br><br>
**You’ll practice inside your own branded, life-like Wellcare Center, powered by
intelligent AI agents like:**\n
• EVA: your Evidence-based Virtual Advisor for preventive well-being\n
• Candise: your Membership recruitment and enrollment manager\n
• Gwen: your Client Services guide, managing member intervention, escalation, and
retention<br><br>
Together, they reduce delivery costs by 60–80%, while you stay focused on what
matters: healing.<br><br>
**So how are we offering all this for $697?**\n
Because we’re not a vendor. We’re the first-ever AI Sandbox collective. In a sandbox
collective, members contribute skills, resources, or capital in exchange for shared
outcomes, whether that’s revenue, equity, learning, or lasting impact. We’ve chosen this
model so that ownership isn’t reserved for investors. It belongs to those building the
future.<br><br>
**Your Founder investment includes:**\n
• Your own virtual, life-like center inside the H6FIT Wellcare Omniverse\n
• A full-stack AI system running on autopilot\n
• Lifetime access to the Wellcare AI Sandbox Summit (August 27)\n
• A seat in the H6FIT Sandbox Collective, where you can help shape, own, and co-create
the AI model\n
• The chance to help bring holistic medicine into every home in America, and beyond<br><br>
**You’re not licensing tech. You’re joining a movement, an uprising.**<br><br>
This is your invitation to practice medicine at an ever-higher level: with profit, purpose,
and powerful support.<br><br>

    FullDesc: `**Why Licensed Functional and Integrative Practitioners Finally Have a System of
Their Own**<br>
AI has been poured into traditional healthcare systems, billing workflows, and administrative
efficiencies, totaling billions of dollars. But what about the practitioners who focus on disease
prevention, mitigation, and even reversal, not just management?<br><br>
What about you, the licensed professionals trained in functional, integrative, lifestyle,
complementary, and alternative medicine? You’ve been completely ignored by the AI revolution.
Until now.<br><br>
The H6FIT AI Wellcare Sandbox Summit will help you transform your practice. You will
experience AI in a collective environment, what we call the ‘sandbox,’ inside the H6FIT Wellcare
Omniverse, the world’s first Virtual, life-like, biophilic habitat for healing and well-being.
Welcome to the new normal: Web 4.0. H6FIT’s AI Wellcare Sandbox Summit introduces you to a
bold new way of confronting the chronic disease crisis.<br><br>
We’ve built a streamlined approach that will take your armamentarium to a whole new level!
And no worries about a learning curve. In this new age of AI in healthcare, our machine-
learned, AI assistants handle it all. They are called AI-agents and they will change the way you
work, forever. Imagine being truly proactive and helping clients prevent, mitigate and reverse
disease.<br><br>
H6FIT’s AI Wellcare Sandbox Summit is the cornerstone of a new, proactive model of care. It
empowers holistic practitioners to deliver their services more efficiently, effectively, and at scale.
As a co-creator, you’ll help shape AI agents to manage repetitive, preventive tasks—educating
and engaging patients. You can then focus on what you do best: diagnosing, guiding, and
healing. Our AI-powered health centers will create something that Web 4.0 has never offered
before.<br><br>
In our ecosystem, ownership isn’t reserved for investors. It’s shared with the practitioners,
coaches, and contributors who are building this with us. This is what the new AI in holistic
therapeutics looks like:<br><br>
A virtual, intelligent, and fully supported practice that runs with you, not against you.
We are a collective and that means we have a purpose-driven organizational structure where
members collectively contribute their skills, resources, or capital in exchange for shared
outcomes. whether that’s revenue, equity, learning, or impact. No one will be second-guessing
your practices here; we are here to support and help you promote your practice. We are on a
shared mission. We want you to experience what decentralized healthcare is like, and we have
a revenue share model that will enhance your bottom line.<br><br>
H6FIT’s AI Wellcare Sandbox Summit was developed specifically for you and for anyone who is
a professional in lifestyle medicine. Our AI-forward system unifies both Functional and
Integrative Therapeutics into a platform that focuses on the holistic six key drivers of well-
being.
It won’t be long! You will meet your new support team:<br><br>

    FullDesc: `Your AI Team. Your Model. Your Future.<br><br>
Every great practitioner deserves an even greater support team. But in today’s fragmented and burnt-out
health landscape, that kind of support is rare. So we built it: intelligently, virtually, and beautifully.<br><br>
**Welcome to the H6FIT Wellcare Platform**<br>
It’s more than software. It’s an autonomous, AI-powered system designed to lower operational costs by
50–70%, increase patient reach, and make your practice more scalable and more human, at the same time.<br><br>
**Meet Your Virtual Wellcare Team**

 •  **EVA** – Evidence-based Virtual Advisor  
 •  **Candise** – Client Acquisition & Membership Development  
 •  **Gwen** – Client Services & Member Retention
Together, they do what no single practitioner can do alone: Run your practice while you stay focused on
healing.<br><br>
**Here’s How They Work**<br>
**EVA** delivers an initial Health Risk Assessment and gathers patient goals. She recommends diagnostics,
creates an evolving evidence-based plan, and supports members through weekly educational modules
across the six pillars of well-being—functional nutrition, mind health, fitness, supplements, hormone
balance, and diagnostics.<br><br>
**Candise** is your always-on business development pro. She educates prospects, handles inbound interest,
follows up with leads, and guides people into your practice. Think of her as your 24/7 enrollment
coordinator, minus the overhead.<br><br>
**Gwen** ensures long-term patient satisfaction and loyalty. She checks in, nudges members back on track,
shares tailored resources, and supports them through every stage of their journey. She’s your
compassionate retention system.<br><br>
With this trio, you can:<br>
 •  Serve 3x the patients at 60–70% lower cost<br>
 •  Operate with high-touch care, at scale<br>
 •  Reduce burnout and eliminate administrative overload<br>
 •  Focus your energy where it matters most: diagnosis, connection, healing<br><br>
**What If A Patient Needs A Personal Visit?**<br>
You’ll be alerted. Your AI team handles the 80%, the education, engagement, and nudges, so you can show
up where your expertise is truly needed. You stay in full control, with smart escalation built in.<br><br>
**This Is Not A Tool. It’s A System AND A Collective.**<br>
When you join the H6FIT AI Sandbox Summit, you get:
 •  A life-like, virtual Practice Center<br>
 •  Three pre-trained, plug-and-play AI agents<br>
 •  A seat at the table to help shape future AI logic<br>
 •  A business model built on collaboration, ownership, and real outcomes<br>
All for just **$697.**<br><br>
That’s not a typo. We’ve invested over $2M and 11 years to build this. Now, we’re opening the door to
functional and integrative pioneers ready to take the lead.<br><br>
**This Is Your Moment To Scale With Purpose.**<br>
To finally have a system that respects your philosophy, amplifies your care, and gives you your time back.
EVA, Candise, and Gwen are ready to work for you.<br><br>
